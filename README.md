Hi, I’m Atieh
- I’m interested in developmental biology, cancer genomics, single-cell multiomics, and computational biology with a focus on AI applications.  
-  I’m currently using advanced bioinformatics, trajectory analysis, and cell-cell communication using tools like CellChat and Monocle 3.  
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving single-cell data analysis, multiomic integration, and spatial transcriptomics.  
- How to reach me: atieh.abedin-do@cshs.org  
- Pronouns: She/Her  
- Fun fact: I love exploring the intersection of science and art through scientific illustrations and visualizations!
